Dad Joke Scrambler

This is a fun game, where you need to figure out the dad quote!  This page grabs a dad joke from the https://icanhazdadjoke.com API and scrambles it.  
The scrambled letters do not correlate at all to the real letters, but if you see a certain letter twice in the quote, that is the same letter.  
To get started here are some hints:
  1) Pay attention to apostrophe's!  They can be 'S or 'T
  2) Single letters are often: A or I
  3) Pay attention to patterns of letters
  4) Three letter words are often "THE" - but not always!
  5) HAVE FUN!!
  
To run the project, open the HTML file.
This project was written in javascript and HTML and includes two Jasmine tests.

Enjoy!
